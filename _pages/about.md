Welcome to my page! I am a researcher interested in asset pricing and the applications of machine learning in finance. I hold a Ph.D in Finance from Boğaziçi University, where I also completed my undergraduate degree in economics. Furthermore, I pursued a Master's degree in Science in Finance from Johns Hopkins University. While I am dedicated to academic pursuits, I have gained substantial professional experience in the finance industry. 

If you would like more details about my qualifications and experiences, please refer to my curriculum vitae ([CV](https://isilcandemir.github.io/cv/)).
